# Bike_Sharing - Multiple Linear Regression Model
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A company ABC has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue.

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the market. 

Business Goal:
A model is required to be built for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
